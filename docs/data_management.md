# Data Management
The `torch_choice` and `bemb` packages share the `ChoiceDataset` data structure for managing choice histories.
The `ChoiceDataset` is an instance of the PyTorch dataset object, which allows for easy training with mini-batch sampling.

We provided a Jupyter notebook for this tutorial as well.

## Setup the Choice-Dataset

Example: `bemb_lightning`.

The BEMB model was initially designed for predicting consumersâ€™ purchasing choices from the supermarket purchase dataset, we use the same setup in this tutorial.

We begin with notations and essential factors of the prediction problem. Suppose there are $I$ items under our consideration and the set of **items** $$i \in \{1,2,\dots,I\}$$ can be grouped into $$C$$ **categories** $$c \in \{1,2,\dots,C\}$$, further, let $$I_c$$ denote the collection of items in category $$c$$.

**Example**:

Since we will be using PyTorch to train our model, we represent their identities using integers. Moreover, this document will use lower cases $$i, c$$, etc to index items and categories respectively.

 Let $$B$$ denote the number of purchasing records in the dataset, each $$b \in \{1,2,\dots, B\}$$ record is associated with an **user** $$u \in \{1,2,\dots,U\}$$ and a **session** $$s \in \{1,2,\dots, S\}$$. When there are multiple items bought in the same shopping trip, there will be multiple rows in the dataset with the same $$(u, s)$$.

One canonical example of session $$s$$ is the date of purchase or the shopping trip.

The `ChoiceDataset` data manager is initialized with the following PyTorch tensors:

1. `label` $$\in \{1,2,\dots,I\}^B$$ : the ID of bought item.
2. `user_index` $$\in \{1,2,\dots,U\}^B$$: the ID of the corresponding user (shopper).
3. `session_index` $$\in \{1,2,\dots,S\}^B$$
4. `item_availability` $$\in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}^{S\times I}$$  identifies the availability of items in each session, the model will ignore unavailable items while making prediction.
5. `user_obs` $$\in \mathbb{R}^{U\times K_{user}}$$
6. `item_obs` $$\in \mathbb{R}^{I\times K_{item}}$$
7. `price_obs` $$\in \mathbb{R}^{S \times I \times K_{price}}$$
