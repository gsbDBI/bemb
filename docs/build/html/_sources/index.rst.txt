Welcome to torch-choice's documentation!
========================================
This package is a `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ based package for, but not limited to, modeling consumer choice.
With the growing size of choice datasets available, existing implementations of consumer choice modelling does not easily scale up modern datasets of millions of records.
Our objective is to provide a versatile interface for managing choice dataset, a range of baseline models (the `torch_choice` part), and a Bayesian Embedding (i.e., BEMB) models for choice modeling that handle large-scale consumer choice datasets in modern research projects.
